Hello Team,
I have automated the "search icon" and "contact search menu item " test cases. 
I have selected those because I feel that these are the major functionality and with the basic automated testcase we can cover the 
high level test case is less time.Regression Test would be covered with less efforts to maintain automated test cases.

I know I have not used the best coding practicies as I have done automation some time back & am new to Selenium.
With limited time, resource & outage in room5.trivago.com, I am only able to deliver 2 Test scenario as required.
However, I assure you If I get time I will learn and implement the others cases as well.

Thanks
Richa
